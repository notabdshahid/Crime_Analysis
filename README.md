# Crime_Analysis
Crime is a pervasive issue that affects the safety, economic stability, and the overall quality of life in a community. Understanding factors that contribute to criminal activity and identifying patterns in crime trends are essential steps in implementing effective policies and interventions. However, given the complex interplay of socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical factors influencing crime, the task of deriving actionable insights from crime data is a non-trivial challenge. This project aims to address these challenges through the application of data analytics and machine learning techniques to explore and analyse crime trends. 
The primary objective of this project is to analyse a crime dataset to uncover key features influencing violent crime rates and evaluate patterns across different states and communities in the United States. The analysis focuses on the following critical aspects:
1.	Feature Importance Identification
2.	Correlation and Perturbation Analysis
3.	Geospatial and Hotspot Analysis
4.	State-by-State Comparison
